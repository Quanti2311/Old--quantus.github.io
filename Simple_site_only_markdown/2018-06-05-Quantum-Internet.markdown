#### _"It is impossible to measure a property of a system without changing it."_

#### _"ID Quantique, for example, a company founded in 2001 in Geneva, Switzerland, built a quantum link that has been protecting the results of Swiss elections for more than ten years."_

**Quantum Internet is expected to be prevalent in a decade, but why it is interesting?**
The main premise: _"A hacker can make a copy of your email now without you ever knowing; a hack of a quantum system, however, is bound by the laws of physics to leave traces." (cosmos magazine)_


**Background:**
_"Quantum cryptography suddenly became more relevant in 1994, when mathematician Peter Shor showed that quantum computers might one day be able to use quantum indeterminacy to break through existing cryptographic schemes with alarming ease. Cracking such schemes – like the ones that keep your internet banking sessions safe from prying eyes – involves finding the factors of extremely large numbers. Shor showed that a quantum computer would be able to do it much more quickly than a classical one."_


**Why it works?**
_"Their idea involved a sender (conventionally known as Alice in cryptography) sending a long string of 1s and 0s to a recipient (call him Bob) that is encoded in photons in such a way that if an eavesdropper (Eve, naturally) conducted any measurements on it, Alice and Bob would know (because measuring a quantum particle changes its properties). They would then throw out any affected 1s and 0s, and be left with an ideal cryptographic key – a long random number they both know but no one else does."_

**Leaders and Leads:**

_China:_

China has launched the first setalite that is aimed at transmiting photons that would carry the necessary infomation for establishing communication (a video call was transmitted to Viena). The Chienese are the leaders in this field (while it seems like the Americans keep their cards close to the chest, with a fog when it comes to this issue.)


_The Netherlands:_

A team at Delft has already started to build the first genuine quantum network, which will link four cities in the Netherlands.
