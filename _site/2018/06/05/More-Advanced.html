<p>Hiya,
Here you can find materials that are a bit more advanced, getting deeper in regards to jargon and quantiness.</p>

<p>Start with: <em>Why now is the right time to study quantum computing</em> a great article by an MIT Prof. <a href="http://localhost:4000/assets/why_now_QC.pdf">here is possible to download the file in PDF</a></p>

<p>This great article summarizes the background to quantum, the advantages and the potential QC entails.
Focus on what are qubits - this is a fairly good explanation.</p>
