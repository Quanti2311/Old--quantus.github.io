Hiya,
Here you can find materials that are a bit more advanced, getting deeper in regards to jargon and quantiness.


Start with: _Why now is the right time to study quantum computing_ a great article by an MIT Prof. [here is possible to download the file in PDF][1]



This great article summarizes the background to quantum, the advantages and the potential QC entails.
Focus on what are qubits - this is a fairly good explanation.
