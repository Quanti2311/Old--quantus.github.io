#### Quantum Key Distribution (QKD):
QKD is what essentially enables satelite-based quantum communication. The photons that are sent in a specific polarized state might be interupted because of the atmosphere and thus the transmission wouldn't hold. QKD solves this problem.

The main key: _the process of measuring a quantum system in general disturbs the system._
