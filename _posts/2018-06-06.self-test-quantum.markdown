#### What quantum computers are good for? provide two classic examples.


### More tiny questions - know the details:
#### Why qubits represent probailities? 
Qubits essentially represent a probability for a qubit to turn into 

#### Why qubits are represented by amplitudes? 
The qubits are considered amplitudes that correspond to the square root of the probability of the bit in the classical terms.
